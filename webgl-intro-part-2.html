        <h1>WebGL: common optimisation techniques</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            There are a lot of different optimization techniques in computer graphics - some of them are pretty common,
            some are highly dependent on a specific case.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most frequently used optimization techniques in WebGL include the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Transfer of calculations from javascript code to shaders.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optimization of rendering of a large number of objects.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now I would like to demonstrate these optimization techniques using the following animation as an example:
        </p>
        <video controls>
            <source src="video/final.mp4" type="video/webm">
        </video>
        <p>
            Animating objects is one of the common use-cases in computer graphics. For example, when you want to, move
            some objects or transform their geometry or color, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar tasks are often solved directly in JavaScript due to the simplicity of implementation. However, this
            can be a weak point in the entire application performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's take a closer look at the calculations used in our animation example.
        </p>
        <p>
            Getting coordinates as a function of time looks quite simple:
        </p>
        <img src="img/part-2/cpu-calc.png" />
        <p>
            However, we should keep in mind that all these calculations will be performed for each frame and they depend
            on the number of animated objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            What does the animation look like before optimization? To demonstrate this, let’s increase objects count to
            about 2500 objects, each consisting of 4 vertices.
        </p>
        <video controls>
            <source src="video/before-optimisation.mp4" type="video/webm">
        </video>
        <h2>Perform calculations on GPU</h2>
        <p>
            As you can see, the frame rate is quite low and the animation doesn’t look smooth. In the browser profiler,
            you can see that the CPU is almost completely loaded (green chart shows frames per second 0-60 and yellow
            one is the CPU load 0-100%).
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to reduce the CPU load, we will transfer the animation to the graphics processing unit (GPU) using
            vertex attributes and uniform variables.
        </p>
        <img src="img/part-2/gpu-calc.png" />
        <p>
            The transformed object coordinates are calculated according to the following data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>explosionDelta</b> - a translation vector used to determine the current position of an object in each
                moment of time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>initialPosition</b> - initial position of the object in the world coordinates.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>internalRotationMatrix</b> - a matrix used to rotate an object
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            WebGL uses matrix calculus. This is not that difficult, but may take some time to adapt. Here is an example
            of creating the rotation matrices that we used above to transform the coordinates of animated objects:
        </p>
        <img src="img/part-2/matrix-example.png" />
        <p>
            On this video you can see the result of our optimization after transferring calculations to the shaders.
            Now the animation is much smoother, but the frame rate is still far from 60 FPS.
        </p>
        <video controls>
            <source src="video/gpu-calc.mp4" type="video/webm">
        </video>

        <h2>Optimize "Lots of Objects" rendering</h2>
        <p>
            Handing a large number of objects is a significant impact on performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Render calls are performed for each object that needs to be drawn and are quite resource intensive.
            Therefore, it is always advisable to minimize the number of draw calls. This can be achieved through
            combining similar objects by merging their geometries.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach slightly changes the way data is conveyed to shaders, for example, in transforming the
            coordinates of each part of such an aggregate object. In particular, <b>uniform variables</b> are no longer
            suitable for this purpose since their values ​​are common to all vertices.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, we use attributes that enable us to set data on each vertex separately. Let us compare the
            code that sets the coordinates of objects before and after merging geometries. Passing coordinates to
            shaders using <b>uniform variables</b>:
        </p>
        <img src="img/part-2/set-coords-before-merge-geom.png" />
        <p>
            And using <b>attributes</b>:
        </p>
        <img src="img/part-2/set-coords-after-merge-geom.png" />
        <p>
            The second method looks more cumbersome, but provides more flexibility when conveying geometry data of
            objects
        </p>
        <video controls>
            <source src="video/after-optimisation.mp4" type="video/webm">
        </video>
        <p>
            The result of the optimization described above can be seen in the video. The result is as follows. As you
            can see, we managed to achieve 60 FPS and the animation is now smooth enough. This also reduced CPU and GPU
            load drastically.
        </p>
